# Towards Improved GADT Reasoning in Scala

This repository contains code accompanying _Towards Improved GADT Reasoning in Scala_, a short paper accepted for publication at the Scala Symposium '19.

Find the code in `src/main/scala`.

## Compiling

The code can be compiled with `sbt compile`.

As we use new Dotty features whose syntax is still evolving, we set up SBT to
use the correct Dotty nightly release.
